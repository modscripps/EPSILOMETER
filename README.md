# EPSILOMETER
aleboyer@ucsd.edu | ncouto@ucsd.edu

This is the epsilometer matlab library.
It can read the .ascii files generated from the SOM acquisition system or directly the file store on the SD card.

- In matlab add this library to yor path. 
- change directory to the location of your data.
- type something like : "data=epsi_class";

The library will create an epis_class which 
- read the data files,  
- convert counts to volts if needed
- contains methods to plot and analyse data. 

The derivation of epsilon and chi is one of the methods. 

Logic flow of the derivations:
- split data into "profiles"
- split profiles in segments
- compute spectra over these segments
- compute epsi and chi over these segments.
